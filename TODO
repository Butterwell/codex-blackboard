. Better design for main blackboard page
  - fix layout of "last update", "last chat"
  - make table cells have consistent widths from round to round
  - fix the bootstrap "affix" component, which isn't properly tracking
    main page scroll position
. Design puzzle information page
  - chat log at top, google drive at bottom, links to full-screen these
. Design round information page
  - like puzzle info page?
. Implement paginated chat log archive page
. Implement paginated database operation log page
. Finish implementing functionality of spec.txt in lib/model.coffee
  - carefully implement puzzle/round reordering functions, use
    MongoDB findAndModify() operation to avoid race conditions when
    rewriting reordered array
     (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/isolate-sequence-of-operations/)
  - add unique indexes to ensure nicks/rounds/etc are unique
     (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/indexes/#index-type-unique
  - add logging operation so that we can show the "last N operations"
. Hook up google drive to newPuzzle/renamePuzzle/delPuzzle in the model
  - google drive operations should happen on server only, not in client
    stuff (test Meteor.isServer()) -- and be careful, since 'drive' field
    will probably not be set immediately in client.  Make sure we cleanly
    handle that case.
. Hook up Instachat code
  - use puzzle/round ids as room names, so we don't have to rename them?
. Add schema for database operation logging
. use puzzle/round name instead of id in url
  - automatically do a Router.navigate() if name changes
