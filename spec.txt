"Tell me a joke"
"What is <person> working on?"
"What's <person>'s real name?"
Abbreviation for puzzle name (special tag?)
"release round" / "release puzzle" -- ensure they don't show up until
names are finalized.  maybe less necessary now?
if puzzle name/number is in the URL, what happens if the name/number
is changed?  alternative is to assign a random hash as the id, not
very friendly.  can we do a live redirect?
