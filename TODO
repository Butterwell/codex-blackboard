. Rework schema to move away from ordered lists in round/roundgroups
  since MongoDB doesn't preserve the order of arrays
. Better design for main blackboard page
  x fix layout of "last update", "last chat"
  - make table cells have consistent widths from round to round
    (use spanX or fixed width blocks instead of tables?)
  x fix the bootstrap "affix" component, which isn't properly tracking
    main page scroll position
  x fix tag layout; compress per-puzzle tags a lot
. Design puzzle information page
  - chat log at top, google drive at bottom, links to full-screen these
. Design round information page
  - like puzzle info page?
x Implement full-window chat screen (port InstaChat), link from blackboard
. Implement paginated chat log archive page
  - and truncate full-window log at the same time
. Implement paginated database operation log page, link from blackboard
. Finish implementing functionality of spec.txt in lib/model.coffee
  - carefully implement puzzle/round reordering functions, use
    MongoDB findAndModify() operation to avoid race conditions when
    rewriting reordered array
     (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/isolate-sequence-of-operations/)
  x add unique indexes to ensure nicks/rounds/etc are unique
     (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/indexes/#index-type-unique
  x add logging operation so that we can show the "last N operations"
. Hook up google drive to newPuzzle/renamePuzzle/delPuzzle in the model
  - google drive operations should happen on server only, not in client
    stuff (test Meteor.isServer()) -- and be careful, since 'drive' field
    will probably not be set immediately in client.  Make sure we cleanly
    handle that case.
x Hook up Instachat code
  x use puzzle/round ids as room names, so we don't have to rename them?
x Add schema for database operation logging
  x tweak schema to allow condensing N "added puzzle X" messages into
    single update line
. use puzzle/round name instead of id in url
  - automatically do a Router.navigate() if name changes
x Smooth relative scrolling when clicking on sidebar links, perhaps using
  jquery's $.localScroll()
x Play audio on the local machine when a puzzle is solved or a new puzzle
  is added.  (Any other events?  We don't want to make it too spammy, but
  getting an answer correct is a time everyone in the room will be cheering
  out loud anyway.)
- add mute button to front page (use instachat's button/cookie?)
  don't know exactly where it goes in the UI
- chat improvements:
  - /me commands (probably needs an 'action' boolean added to the schema)
  - /play {trombone, rimshot, crickets}, maybe using the below:
  - URL parsing (ie, links to images display them, links to sounds play them)
    (i think hubot-scripts uses some functionality like this)
  - file upload via the google drive folder attached to the puzzle/round
  - nick completion (@foo?)
