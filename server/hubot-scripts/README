These are stock hubot scripts, with one exception:
Instead of:
  modules.export = (robot) ->
Use:
  share.hubot.ping = (robot) ->

Note that the name of the script is given as the field name.

This directory is intended for scripts which are tightly integrated
with Meteor and the codex blackboard.  For packaged hubot scripts
and lightly-modified forked packages, add the code to the
github:cscott/codex-blackboard-hubot-scripts package (see the
README there) and then update the git commit hash in the
`packages/codex-blackboard-hubot-scripts/package.js` file
in this repo.
